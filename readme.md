### orb

There is no center of the solar system. You can use any planet as the center, or any point in space for that matter. The rules of gravity will still apply the same way.

When using the Sun, we recover the traditional heliocentric model first described by Copernicus in the 16th century. And, when using the Earth, we recover the geocentric model first described by Ptolemy in the 2nd century, with all it's epicycles and deferents.

### Usage
You need python3 and cargo installed.

```bash
# initialise the planetary data
make init

# run simulation directly
make run

# run web version
make web
```
